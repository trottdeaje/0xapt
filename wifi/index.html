                        WiFi is something that we all use every single day. Do you ever think about the risks
                        whenever you connect to someone else's WAP (Wireless Access Point) on the day to
                        day?<br><br>

                        I'm going to cover a few attacks that can happen over a wireless network, but first..
                        How do you get started in hacking wifi?



                        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 60px; margin-top: 60px;width:100%">Terminology </h1>

                        To really understand how to hack Wi-Fi, we need to dispense with basic terms and technology.
                        First, let's address some terminology.<br><br>

                        To begin, the access point that sends out the radio frequency (RF) signal is known as the AP.
                        These APs are capable of
                        sending out signals (between 2.4 and 5 Ghz) that comply with a number of different standards.
                        These standards are known as
                        802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. In the very near future, we'll see a new standard
                        that's tentatively named 802.11ac.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px; width:100%">
                        The table below summarizes the key features of these Wi-Fi standards.
                    </p>


                    <img style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 3%; border: 3px white solid;"
                        src="https://img.wonderhowto.com/img/03/62/63508466621500/0/hack-wi-fi-getting-started-with-terms-technologies.w1456.jpg"
                        alt="WiFi network standard chart">

                    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                        These standards are generally backwardly compatible, so that a wireless n adapter will also be
                        able to pick up g and b signals.
                        We will focus upon the most widely used of these standardsâ€” b, g, and n.
                    </p>

                    <h1 style="margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 80px; width:100%">Security Technology </h1>

                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                        From the perspective of the hacker, wireless security technologies are among the most pertinent
                        features. Multiple security technologies
                        have been deployed in Wi-Fi to make an inherently insecure technology secure.<br><br> Our attack
                        approach will depend upon which of these security technologies is being deployed.
                        So, let's take a quick look at them here.
                    </p>


                    <h2 style="margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 60px; width:100%">- WEP -</h2><br><br>

                    <p>
                        WEP, or wired equivalent privacy, was the first wireless security scheme employed. As it name
                        implies, it was designed to
                        provide security to the end-user that was essentially equivalent to the privacy that was enjoyed
                        in a wired environment.
                        Unfortunately, it failed miserably.<br><br>

                        For a number of reasons, WEP is extraordinarily easy to crack because of a flawed implementation
                        of the RC4 encryption algorithm.
                        It's not unusual to be able to crack WEP in less than 5 minutes. This is because WEP used a very
                        small (24-bit) initialization vector
                        (IV) that could be captured in the datastream, and this IV could then be used to discover the
                        password using statistical techniques.<br><br>

                        Despite this, I still find it being used in household and small business implementations, but
                        seldom in an enterprise environment.

                    </p>

                    <h2 style="margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;width: 100%">- WPA -</h2>

                    <p style="width:100%">
                        WPA was the response by the industry to the revealed weaknesses of WEP. It's often referred to
                        as WPA1 to distinguish it from WPA2.

                        WPA used Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to improve the security of WEP without requiring
                        new hardware.
                        It still uses WEP for encryption, but it makes the statistical attacks used to crack WEP much
                        more difficult and time-consuming.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 60px; width:100%">- WPA2-AES -</h2><br><br>

                    <p>

                        WPA2-AES is the enterprise implementation of WPA2. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard or
                        AES to encrypt data
                        and is the most secure. It's often coupled with a RADIUS server that is dedicated for
                        authentication.

                        Although cracking it is possible, it significantly more difficult.
                    </p>


                    <h1 style="margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 60px; width:100%"> Channels </h1><br><br>

                    <p style="width:100%;">
                        Like our radio, wireless has multiple channels so that various communication streams don't
                        interfere with each other.
                        The 802.11 standard allows for channels ranging from 1 thru 14.<br><br>

                        In the U.S., the FCC regulates wireless communication and devices for use in the states are only
                        enabled to use channels
                        1 thru 11. Europe uses channels 1 thru 13 and Japan 1 thru 14. Other nations may also use
                        the full range.<br><br>

                        For the hacker, this can be useful information as a rogue AP using channel 12 thru 14 would be
                        invisible to U.S.-made wireless
                        devices and security professionals scanning for rogue access points.<br>
                    </p>

                    <img style="width: 40%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 4%; margin-bottom:3%; border: 3px white solid;"
                        src="https://img.wonderhowto.com/img/79/27/63508467052216/0/hack-wi-fi-getting-started-with-terms-technologies.w1456.jpg"
                        alt="WiFi Image">

                    <p style="width:100%;">
                        <br>
                        Each channel has a width of 22 Mhz around its central frequency. To avoid interference, an AP
                        can use any of these channels, but
                        to avoid any overlap, channels 1, 6, and 11 are most often utilized in the U.S. The other
                        channels can be used, but because
                        you need five channels between the working channels to not overlap signals,
                        with three or more channels, only 1, 6, and 11 will work.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h1 style="width:100%; margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 80px;">Datagrams and Frames </h1>

                    <p>
                        An understanding of the structure of wireless datagrams is critical for successful wireless
                        hacking, but is beyond the scope
                        of this introduction. I will introduce some of this information when necessary in future
                        tutorials, but you may want
                        to take some time to study wireless frames and datagrams from other sources.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h1 style="width:100%; margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 80px;">Signal Strength </h1>

                    <p style="width:100%">
                        In the U.S., the FCC regulates among other things, the strength of the wireless access point's
                        signal. The FCC says that the
                        access point's signal cannot exceed 27 dBm (500 milliwatts). Most access points have this limit
                        built-in, but we can change
                        and override this limitation, if the access point is capable of a stronger signal. This may be
                        useful for
                        the hacker in setting up evil twins and rogue access points where strength of signal is
                        critical, among other techniques.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h1 style="width:100%; margin-bottom:80px; margin-top: 80px;"> Aircrack-ng </h1>

                    <p>

                        For nearly all of our Wi-Fi hacking, we will be using aircrack-ng which is included in Kali
                        Linux. Even in those hacks where
                        we use other tools such cowpatty or reaver, we will use the aircrack-ng suite of tools for some
                        part of the hack,
                        so we need to become familiar with it.<br><br>

                        One of the crucial needs to becoming an effective Wi-Fi hacker is the Wi-Fi adapter. Generally,
                        the Wi-Fi adapter on your
                        laptop or desktop is insufficient for our purposes. The key capability we need is the ability to
                        inject packets into the
                        access point and most run-of-the-mill wireless adapters are incapable of packet injection.
                        <br><br>Aircrack-ng has a <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers"
                            target="_blank">list of
                            Wi-Fi adapters</a> that can work with their suite of tools.<br><br>

                        That having been said, I highly recommend Alfa AWUS036NH USB wireless adapter. This is what I
                        use. <br><br>
                        It's available from several locations for between $30 to $50.

                        It does everything I need, is fast, has an external antenna, is recognized by BackTrack, and
                        automatically loads its drivers. <br><br>
                        In addition, it comes in 1000mw and 2000mw versions. That can be critical in rogue access point
                        hacks, despite the
                        fact that the FCC limits signal strength the 500mw.<br><br>

                    <p style="width:100%;">
                        Antennas come in two basic types, omni-directional and directional. Most APs and wireless
                        adapters come
                        with omni-directional antennas, meaning that they send and receive in all directions.<br><br>

                        The Alfa card that I recommend comes with an external antenna that is omni-directional, but has
                        a gain of 5dBi
                        (gain is a measure when applied to antennas, of how much the antenna can increase the signal).
                        <br><br>
                        This means that it can increase the signal by focusing the signal similar to that of a
                        reflector on a flashlight. In addition, it can change position to better receive particular

                        signals as well as a cable and suction cup adapter for mounting on a wall or window.<br><br>

                        Directional antennas can also be useful for hacking when attempting to focus your exploits to a
                        remote access point.
                        The literature contains references to Wi-Fi signals that have been sent and received over 100
                        miles or about 160km
                        using directional antennas. For most commercial directional antennas, you can expect to be able
                        to pick up wireless
                        communication up to 4km or 2.4 miles.<br><br>

                        These can be obtained from a variety of sources usually for under $100 with a gain of between
                        15dBi and 20dBi. A Yagi antenna
                        is an example of a directional antenna that is often used in hacking wireless over significant
                        distances.<br><br>
